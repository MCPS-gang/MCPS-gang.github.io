### What You Need

* An open copy of [the legendary doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zAJtsN7Z2IK86vVVhb0NsZxJGxeAG4NM8FRt9-59eg/edit?usp=sharing)

### Instructions

1. Open the 'cs' doc and download Wallpaper Engine from the provided link
1. After the download is finished, open 7-Zip and browse to your Chrome folder `(C:\Users\[your student num]\Downloads\Chrome\)`
1. Extract the download to its own folder
  + Note: There is a big button at the top of the 7-Zip window that says "extract"
  + Note: 7-Zip should automatically make a subfolder to extract your stuff. There's no need to make a new one, just make sure you don't happen to click 'Extract here'
  + Reminder: the password will always be this(unless stated otherwise):

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/pw.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}
    

1. Open Explorer and brow
1. Go back into 7-Zip and open the folder where you extracted the game. Keep going into the subfolders until you find the game's EXE file
1. Drag the game's EXE into the SmartSteamEmu Launcher window

1. There will be a text field to input the game's app ID. This number is provided in the 'cs' doc, contained in the [brackets] next to the game's name. For Enter The Gungeon, it is 311690.

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/SSEsettings.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}


1. Click 'save'
1. From now on, you will be able to launch the game from this shortcut you made in SmartSteamEmu.

#### Information and Notes

{% capture notice-10 %}
Remember to turn your game settings down!

If you are playing a game that supports Steam multiplayer(Terraria, CS:GO, Rivals Of Aether, etc.), you can start a multiplayer game just as you normally would on Steam. Anyone who wants to join can do so by pressing [Shift+Tab] to open the overlay, then opening the friends list. If someone else is hosting, you can Right-click on their name and join.

If you get the direct patch of SSELauncher.exe, you can make a shortcut for it, in the same way we did earlier in the guide with 7-Zip.

If your game gives a VAC error, go into SmartSteamEmu `File -> Settings -> Advanced Settings` and disable "Secured Servers". Ask your friends to do the same, if they're the ones hosting.
