title: "Setting up BO2"
---

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### What You Need

* An open copy of the legendary 'cs' doc(since you're here, someone should've shared it with you)
* Enough time for BO2 to download(it is ~21 GB and may take most of the class period)

### Instructions

1. Open the 'cs' doc and download BO2 from the provided link
1. Download the 'Required patch' that is seen next to BO2
1. Extract BO2 to its own folder (do not extract the patch yet)
  + Note: There is a big button at the top of the 7-Zip window that says "extract"
  + Note: 7-Zip should automatically make a subfolder to extract your stuff. There's no need to make a new one, just make sure you don't happen to click 'Extract here'
  + Reminder: the password will always be this(unless stated otherwise):

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/pw.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}
    
1. After BO2 is finished extracting, go inside its folder and into the folder where all the EXEs are. Copy the address for this folder at the top of your screen
1. Navigate back to the patch, select it, and click Extract. For the 'Extract to' path, paste the folder path you had copied earlier
  + Make sure this subdirectory checkbox is UNCHECKED:

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/checkbox.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}

1. When asked to overwrite files (it should ask you this), say yes
1. The game is now fully installed. You may launch Zombies from `t6rzm.exe` and Multiplayer from `t6rmp.exe`
  + Note: These are not the same as `t6zm.exe` and `t6mp.exe`

### Notice: When launching the game, you will see a command prompt window and it will seem like it is hanging. Be patient: do not click inside the command prompt window(clicking may activate 'select', and the game will not launch until everything is de-selected) and wait about 2 or 3 minutes, until a warning dialog shows up(you might not notice it). When it does, click 'OK' to launch the game.

### In-game Setup (first time)

1. When in-game, hit [Escape] until the 'downloading playlists' loading screen goes away, then click on 'Unlock a lot', then 'Continue to main menu'.
1. Open the console with the tilde key (`~`) and type `name [any name]` to change your name, then press [Enter]
1. Head into game settings and turn them down. It is not necessarily about turning down the resolution (the game is at 800x600 by default anyway, you can turn it up if you'd like), but more about turning down all the graphics and advanced settings. Things like anti-aliasing(FXAA, MSAA) and ambient occlusion can cause a big performance hit
  + Note: settings files are DIFFERENT for multiplayer and zombies, meaning you will have to do your first-time setup on each one.
1. If you are hosting multiplayer and are having trouble starting a game, you can force it to start by opening the console and typing `xpartygo` and pressing [Enter]
1. If you are trying to connect to someone else's game that they are hosting(whether it's multiplayer or zombies), make sure they [get their IP](ipcfg). Then, **without going into the custom games menu**, open the console and type `connect [insert the host's IP here]` and press [Enter]
  + If you go into the custom games menu before doing this, your game will crash(black screen) when joining.
  + Even though the host is on custom games, people joining will only be able to use their 'Public Match' custom classes, so make those.
