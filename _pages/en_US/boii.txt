title: "Setting up BO2"

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### What You Need

* An open copy of the legendary 'cs' doc(since you're here, someone should've shared it with you)
* Enough time for BO2 to download(it is ~21 GB and may take most of the class period)

### Instructions

1. Open the 'cs' doc and download BO2 from the provided link
1. Download the 'Required patch' that is seen next to BO2
1. Extract the download to its own folder
  + Note: There is a big button at the top of the 7-Zip window that says "extract"
  + Note: 7-Zip should automatically make a subfolder to extract your stuff. There's no need to make a new one, just make sure you don't happen to click 'Extract here'
  + Reminder: the password will always be this(unless stated otherwise):

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/pw.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}
    



1. There will be a text field to input the game's app ID. This number is provided in the 'cs' doc, contained in the [brackets] next to the game's name. For CS:GO, it is 730.

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/csgo.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}


1. Click 'save'
1. From now on, you will be able to launch the game from this shortcut you made in SmartSteamEmu.
1. Launch the game, and wait a minute or two, the computers are slow. If the game does not launch, download 'csgo_dx' from the doc, and extract it to the same place where you extracted 'extra'. Again, overwrite when asked, then try to launch the game again.

#### Information and Notes

{% capture notice-10 %}
Remember to turn your game settings down!

If you are playing a game that supports Steam multiplayer(Terraria, CS:GO, Rivals Of Aether, etc.), you can start a multiplayer game just as you normally would on Steam. Anyone who wants to join can do so by pressing [Shift+Tab] to open the overlay, then opening the friends list. If someone else is hosting, you can Right-click on their name and join.

If you get the direct patch of SSELauncher.exe, you can make a shortcut for it, in the same way we did earlier in the guide with 7-Zip.

If your game gives a VAC error, go into SmartSteamEmu `File -> Settings -> Advanced Settings` and disable "Secured Servers", then relaunch the game. Ask your friends to do the same, if they're the ones hosting.

Note: the 'extra' folder adds surf maps and bhop maps. You can load them with the `map` command in the console(after enabling it in the settings), and then load the appropriate configs for each map by doing `exec surf` or `exec bhop` after the map loads.
