### Required Reading

Before starting, you must know that this guide will install programs to the school computer's *local* drive. This means that if you ever switch computers for any reason(if you pick a different one each time) or your computer happens to get wiped(this does happen, though not too often), you must reinstall anything you had if you hope to use it again.

{% capture notice-1 %}
If you will be playing games, obviously be cautious when the teacher is near. Alt+Tab is your best friend, as well as Ctrl+Win+[Arrow key left or right] if you have made other desktops to keep your gaming in(this is the optimal setup).
