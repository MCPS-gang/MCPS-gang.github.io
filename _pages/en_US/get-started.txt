### Required Reading

Before starting, you must know that this guide will install programs to the school computer's *local* drive. This means that if you ever switch computers for any reason(if you pick a different one each time) or your computer happens to get wiped(this does happen, though not too often), you must reinstall anything you had if you hope to use it again.

There have been reports of a wave of bans being handed out to CFW users by Nintendo. To protect yourself, please do the following steps before starting this guide:

1. Go to System Settings, then "Internet Settings", then "SpotPass", then "Sending of System Information"
1. Disable the "Sending of System Information" option
1. Exit the System Settings
1. Go to your Friend List (the [orange Face Icon]({{ "/images/friend-list-icon.png" | absolute_url }}) in the top row of your Home Menu)
  + If you receive an error and are kicked out of the menu, the Friend List setting is either already disabled or your console cannot connect to Nintendo's servers (due to a ban or connection issues)
1. Go to the Friend List settings, then "Friend Notification Settings", then "Show friends what you're playing"
1. Disable the "Show friends what you're playing" option
