### Note: This is nearly the same as the [Installing a Steam Game](SSE) page, but with minor tweaks that are specific to CS:GO.
{: .notice--primary}

### What You Need

* An open copy of the legendary 'cs' doc(since you're here, someone should've shared it with you)
* Enough time for CS:GO to download

### Instructions

1. Open the 'cs' doc and download SSE from the provided link(only if you don't already have it)
1. Find the link called 'extra' in the doc and start downloading it
1. Find the link for the CS:GO in the doc, and start the download for it as well
  + If you get a 'You Need Permission' error page, log out of your account and refresh the page
1. After the downloads are finished, open 7-Zip and browse to your Chrome folder `(C:\Users\[your student num]\Downloads\Chrome\)`
1. Extract CS:GO and SmartSteamEmu to separate folders
  + Do not extract 'extra' yet!
  + Note: There is a big button at the top of the 7-Zip window that says "extract"
  + Note: 7-Zip should automatically make a subfolder to extract your stuff. There's no need to make new ones, just make sure you don't happen to click 'Extract here'
  + Reminder: the password will always be this(unless stated otherwise):

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/pw.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}
    
1. Open the folder where you extracted the game. Keep going into the subfolders until you find the game's EXE file
1. Don't touch the exe file. Instead, copy the folder path that's shown at the top of the 7-Zip window
1. Navigate back to where 'extra' is downloaded, and click Extract. For the 'Extract to' path, paste the folder path you had copied earlier
  + Make sure this subdirectory checkbox is UNCHECKED:
  
    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/checkbox.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}

1. Click OK to start extraction. It SHOULD ask you to overwrite files. Click 'Yes to All' when it does
  + If it does not ask you to overwrite files, you did something wrong within the last few steps
1. Open the folder where you extracted SmartSteamEmu, and run `SSELauncher.exe`
  + If there happens to already be a label that says 'csgo' in SmartSteamEmu, just click on it once and hit the [delete] key
1. Go back into 7-Zip and open the folder where you extracted the game. Keep going into the subfolders until you find the game's EXE file
1. Drag the game's EXE into the SmartSteamEmu Launcher window

1. There will be a text field to input the game's app ID. This number is provided in the 'cs' doc, contained in the [brackets] next to the game's name. For CS:GO, it is 730.

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/csgo.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}


1. Click 'save'
1. From now on, you will be able to launch the game from this shortcut you made in SmartSteamEmu.
1. Launch the game, and wait a minute or two, the computers are slow. If the game does not launch, download 'csgo_dx' from the doc, and extract it to the same place where you extracted 'extra'. Again, overwrite when asked, then try to launch the game again.

#### Information and Notes

{% capture notice-10 %}
Remember to turn your game settings down!

If you are playing a game that supports Steam multiplayer(Terraria, CS:GO, Rivals Of Aether, etc.), you can start a multiplayer game just as you normally would on Steam. Anyone who wants to join can do so by pressing [Shift+Tab] to open the overlay, then opening the friends list. If someone else is hosting, you can Right-click on their name and join.

If you get the direct patch of SSELauncher.exe, you can make a shortcut for it, in the same way we did earlier in the guide with 7-Zip.

If your game gives a VAC error, go into SmartSteamEmu `File -> Settings -> Advanced Settings` and disable "Secured Servers", then relaunch the game. Ask your friends to do the same, if they're the ones hosting.

Note: the 'extra' folder adds surf maps and bhop maps. You can load them with the `map` command in the console(after enabling it in the settings), and then load the appropriate configs for each map by doing `exec surf` or `exec bhop` after the map loads.
