### What You Need

* An open copy of [the legendary doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zAJtsN7Z2IK86vVVhb0NsZxJGxeAG4NM8FRt9-59eg/edit?usp=sharing)
* Around 3MB or more of space left in your school network drive.
* About 5 minutes of your time.

### Instructions

1. Open the 'cs' doc and download *7zp* from the provided link
1. Run the intaller that you just downloaded, choose English(optional), and press Next
1. On the window asking for the install location, change it to `C:\Users\[your student number]\7zp\` 
  + (do not click 'browse')

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/install_dir.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}

1. Click install, and close the installer *without* running the program after it is done
1. Open your downloads folder
1. Right click on the blank space and hit `New -> Shortcut`
1. Where it asks you to type the item location, type `C:\Users\[your student number]\7zp\7-zipportable.exe` 
  + (if it gives you an error for a file not found here, you did something wrong at some point)
1. Name it whatever you'd like, and hit Finish
1. Launch 7-Zip from the shortcut you just made. This is where you'll be launching it from now on
1. In 7-Zip, navigate to `C:\Users\[your student num]\Downloads\`
1. Right click on the blank space there, then make a new folder named `Chrome`
1. In 7-Zip, navigate to `C:\Users\[your student num]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\`
1. Scroll all the way down and locate the file named `Preferences`, then double-click it and choose open with Notepad
1. With the file open in Notepad, hit `Ctrl+F` and type `download` into the find window
1. Somewhere on the screen, you should see something that looks like `"download":{"directory_upgrade":true,"prompt_for_download":false}` or similar
1. BEFORE the `"directory_upgrade"`, add `"default_directory":"C:\\Users\\[your student number]\\Downloads\\Chrome",`
1. The final result should look like this:

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/preferences.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}


1. Close all instances of Google Chrome, wait about 5 seconds, then save the preferences file that you currently have open in Notepad.
1. Close notepad, then launch Chrome.
1. Open Chrome settings. If everything was done correctly, the download directory should be changed to where you set it in the file.
  + Make sure that 'Ask where to save each file before downloading' is off.

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/chrome_settings.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}
